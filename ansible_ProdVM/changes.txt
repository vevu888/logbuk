LogAnalysis - Code changes

1. Adjust logstash.conf
    a. Disable the replacing of @timestamp field with the creation timestamp
        * This allows the end-user to see if the module is showing a wrong timestamp or invalid timestamp
        * It improves troubleshooting on the modules side
    b. Comment out lines 91 - 92.
