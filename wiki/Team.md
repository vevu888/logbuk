# Sprint Retroperspective.

# Sprint Planning
* PO or ScrumMaster create Sprint.
* Approved PBIs are loaded into Sprint from the backlog.
* ScrumTeam determines their capacity for each sprint; vacation, availability.
* Approved PBIs in Sprint are checked and withdrawn if necessary. 
* All remaining PBIs are set to Committed.

# Product Backlog (PB).
How will we primarily identify PBIs.
* Epics and features will be specified by the PO.
* Epics and Features can be created from the team in consultation with the PO if necessary. Status New will be set to Approved by creator and PO.
* Epics and features from the team must be described. Otherwise there is no Approved.
* Epics and Features possibly UserStory contain Stakholder. These must be picked up at completion. 
* In Refinement we will determine PBIs, if necessary also the StoryPoints. The DoR is to be achieved.
* In Sprint Change, we will transfer PBIs from the Backlog to the future Sprint according to Prio. However, PBIs must be DoR.
* PBIs (Userstory) will be set to Done by the team.
* PBIs (Userstory) will be set to Closed by PO.
* PBIs (Epic/Features) should be refined in a Quarterly Sprint by the Team.
